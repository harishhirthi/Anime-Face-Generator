# Anime-Face-Generator
Interesting Topic as a part of **Generative AI** to generate different Anime Faces.

## Description:
***Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network [DCGANS]***, one of a prominent network for approaching Generative AI, built with Pytorch to generate new and 
artificial Anime Faces. These GANs are based on **Unsupervised Learning** which analyses and generate the variations data within the given dataset.

## Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/splcher/animefacedataset
